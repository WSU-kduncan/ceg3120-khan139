# Project 0 - Git Guide

## Command line git

- status
  - Shows status of the local repository. This status includes:
    - number of local commits that have not been synced with remote (GitHub)
    - list of files in local folder than are NOT being tracked by git
    - list of files in local folder that have changes that need to be committed
  - `git status`
- clone
  - Is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository
    - By cloning with Git, you get the entire repository - all files, all branches, and all commits
    - Once a repository already exists on a remote, like on GitHub, then you would clone that repository so you could interact with it locally
  - `git clone [url]`
- add
  - Adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area
    - This step allows you to choose what you are going to commit
    - Allows you to systematically shape your commits and your history anyway
  - `git add <filename>`
- rm
  - Removes specific files or a group of files from a Git repository
    - Used for removing files from both the staging index and the working directory
  - `git rm <filename>`
- commit
  - Captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes
    - Commits are the building blocks of "save points" within Git's version control
	- By using commits, you're able to craft history intentionally and safely
  - `git commit -a -m "commit message"`
- push
  - Uploads all local branch commits to the corresponding remote branch
    - Updates the remote branch with local commits
	- Comparable to *publish* or *update*
  - `git push`
- fetch
  - Used to download commits, files and references from a remote repository into the local repository
	- Used to see what other members of the team have been working on
	- Does not force to merge the changes into the repository, it just shows the progression of the central history
  - `git fetch --all`
- merge
  - Integrates the independent lines of development into a single branch
	- Primary use it to merge to branches
	- Used to merge multiple commits into one history
  - `git merge <branchname>`
- pull
  - Updates your current local working branch, and all of the remote tracking branches
	- Should be run regularly on the branches you are working on locally
	- Without running it, your local repository will never be updated with changes from the remote
  - `git pull`
- branch
  - Creates, lists and deletes branches
	- Accepted as a way to request a new working directory, staging area and project history
	- Are a pointer to a snapshot of the changes you have made
  - `git branch <filename>`
- checkout
  - Switches branches or restores working tree files
	- Operates on files, commits, and branches
	- Allows switching between multiple features in just a single repository
  - `git checkout -b <branchname>`
- ~~init~~
- ~~remote~~

## git files & folders

- .git folder
  - Contains all information that is necessary for the project and all information relating commits, remote repository address, etc
	- Contains a log that stores the commit history
	- Hooks, objects, config, refs, HEAD, and index
- .gitignore file
  - File that holds list of files / directories you want ignored
	- Git status will no longer show these as files to be added
	- Used to keep excess or secrets off GitHub
  - `‏‏‎vim .gitignore` `git add .gitignore`
- ~~.git/hooks~~

## GitHub

- Pull requests
  - Forum like interface on GitHub where you can request changes be merged
	- Is requesting the maintainer of a repository to git pull in some changes 
- SSH authentication to repositories
  - SSH public key authentication works with an asymmetric pair of generated encryption keys
	- Provides a secure channel over an unsecured network
  - `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"`
- ~~Actions~~
